For instructors, an email containing a unique link will be sent to his/her email address. The instructor will be directed to a page that requires him/her to input his first name, last name, username, password and a short autobiography. After the instructor enters his/her credentials, the info will be stored in the database, the username and password will be ready to log into the system. For learners, he/she should first visit the learner homepage, where he/she will be asked to input his/her staff ID. After confirmation of the validility of his ID, an email with a unique link will be send to his/her company email address. The later process will be similar to that of instructors.
